###Requirements
- Pandas
This python script takes in a filepath full of CSV files generated by DashWare. The script makes sure to track accumulating values such as distance traveled or altitude climbed. I use a GoPro Hero 7 Silver. It is possible other models will have more/less telemetry data, let me know or send a PR with any tweaks you see to add.
